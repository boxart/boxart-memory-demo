[BoxArt](https://github.com/boxart/boxart) and [BoxArt-Boiler](https://github.com/boxart/boxart-boiler) are tools for building fast, modern, and responsive HTML web games.

The HTML Document Object Model and its accompanying CSS box model lend themselves to responsive 2D-casual game board layouts. The highly-tuned HTML render flows of our browsers are more battery safe than canvas or WebGL alternatives, while also providing opportunities for graphics acceleration and performance. With boxart-boiler games, the idea is to build DOM-first. If you want to drop down into lower level drawing APIs, you can always temporarily rasterize and enhance an element outside of boxart.

Moreover, HTML gives us a way to represent whatever information we mean to convey visually, no matter how complex, in a way that assistive technologies can tap into. This is how we can make truly _open_ Open Web Games.
