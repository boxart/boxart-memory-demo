# Contributor's Guide

There are lots of ways to contribute to this repo! Here are guidelines for a 
few of them:

### Code

If you're interested in contributing code to this repository open a pull 
request. We're happy to review initial approach and any proof of concept work, 
just mark your PR as being in progress by adding `[WIP]` to its title.

For a PR to merge it must comply with `eslint` and cause no test failures. If
the `grunt test` and `grunt build` tasks run without errors, you're 
probably good to go. Ideally PR's will include tests to prove efficacy, but if 
you're unsure how to approach writing the tests, just open your PR as `[WIP]` 
and leave a comment to that effect so we can make time to support you.

### Bug Testing

The hope is for this boilerplate to empower folks to build responsive and 
accessible games on the web. If you notice a bug on any device or browser for
our example games please open an issue and tell us so. 

There are some things your issue must include:

  - steps to reproduce
  - OS version, browser make, and browser version you tested with
  - expected result vs actual result
  
And some things that aren't necessary but would be tremendously helpful:

  - images, gifs, or videos of the behavior
  - a PR that fix's the problem or adds a test that fails due to it

### Developer Experience Feedback

If you have any feedback to share about your experience using this 
boilerplate, questions about how or why something in it works, or suggestions
on how to make it better open an issue and tell us.

### Evangelizing

If you think this project is cool, tell other people.
